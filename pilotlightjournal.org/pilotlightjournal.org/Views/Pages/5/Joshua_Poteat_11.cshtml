The jessamine cut back, the wisteria ordered 
and blunt from the rails. We have to be humble 
or we’re taken down. 

How many examples do you need? 
Soft as milk-shaped light in the halfway house
where the sex offenders live. 

An owl in another country invented night. 

You must remember
this is not about history.

It’s about finding where life enters our deaths.
