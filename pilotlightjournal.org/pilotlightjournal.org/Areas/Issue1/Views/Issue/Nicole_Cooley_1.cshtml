        In her poem “What Calendars Have Become,” Tory Dent describes her poetics: “I refer to the world but I speak of the body” 
        (@Html.ActionLink("35", "Nicole_Cooley", "Issue", null, null, "wc2", new { page = 3 }, new { @class = "workscited-links" })).  
        Diagnosed with HIV at age 30, Dent has written three books of poetry — What Silence Equals (1993), HIV, Mon Amour (1999), and 
        Black Milk (2005) — which explore AIDS and its range of social, political and personal implications. She is, to my knowledge, 
        the only woman poet in America to publish several volumes of poems about living with HIV and AIDS.  But all of Dent’s work 
        resists being classified as “representative” poetry about AIDS. Her poetry is often regarded as difficult, with its reliance 
        on strategies of Language Poetry and the New York School, its long Whitmanesque line structure, its web of allusions.

        Recently, I’ve been thinking about how Tory Dent fits into the category “woman poet” and whether or not this is a useful 
        category for talking about her work.  I have taught Dent’s work in undergraduate Twentieth Century Women Poets classes a 
        number of times. For the most part, her poems appear not in anthologies of women’s writing but in volumes of AIDS poetry 
        (such as In the Company of My Solitude) and experimental work (The Exact Change Yearbook). The one “women’s anthology” 
        in which Dent’s work appears is Bearing Life: Women’s Writing on Childlessness (edited by the late Rochelle Ratner). 
        In this book, Dent has contributed a prose piece, a selection from an unpublished memoir, titled “The Deferred Dream.” 
        Dent writes:
    </p>
    <div class="excerpt-formatting-3">
        Writing about my living with AIDS is always painful for me. But it is—always—what I write about; I can’t think of anything 
        else to say. In the desire to write is the desire to communicate, I believe. I’m sharing with someone and in that process 
        trying to understand myself what I’m thinking or feeling . . . .  By writing  I hope to feel closer to the world. Its what 
        I want. Its more and more what I want as I lose slowly, incrementally, unpredictably and of course unfortunately my 
        physical grip on the world.  It is AIDS weakens my grip. . .  My organic body, born into this world and made up of this 
        world as its by-product, is the rejecting factor.

        In this passage, the body presents a terrible paradox: as Dent loses her “physical grip” on the world and uses her writing 
        to bring her closer to the world, it is her body that rejects that closeness. It is significant that this passage opens Dent’s 
        piece on wanting a child—and having an abortion as she was urged to do because of her HIV status –and that it is included 
        in the volume of women writers. Her inclusion in the anthology and her statement here are often the starting point for my 
        discussion of Dent when I situate Dent’s books in my women poets class. For two reasons, I teach Dent’s work consistently 
        in this class.
